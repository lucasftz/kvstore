A key value store written in Rust.

COMMANDS:
	add <KEY> <VALUE>	Add a key value pair to the database
	get <KEY>		Access the corresponding value of <KEY>
	help			List all commands and their uses
	list			List all keys stored in the database
	remove <KEY>		Remove a key value pair from the database

SECRET KEYS:
Adding a key prefixed by a dot will make it a secret key! It won't be listed though the list command, but you will be able to access its value normally.
